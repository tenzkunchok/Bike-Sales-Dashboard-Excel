# Bike Sales Dashboard – Excel Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzed a dataset of bike buyers to identify trends in demographics and purchasing behavior. Using Excel, the data was cleaned, organized, and visualized in an interactive dashboard. The findings showed that middle-aged customers with higher incomes were more likely to purchase bikes, with most buyers having shorter commute distances. Filters for marital status, region, and education allow further exploration of specific customer segments.
